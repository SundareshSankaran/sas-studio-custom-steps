# Anonymize and Mask Data

## Description

>[!NOTE]
>The **Mask Data** step in the **Transform Data** group in the **Steps** pane in SAS Studio, introduced in release 2023.07, provides the same functionality, and it is highly recommended to use that step going forward.

The **Anonymize and Mask Data** custom step enables SAS Studio users to select a standardization definition from the [SAS Quality Knowledge Base (QKB)](https://support.sas.com/en/software/quality-knowledge-base-support.html#documentation) to mask or anonymize data in a selected column.  The selected column is dropped from the output and its masked version is returned instead.  For more information on how this custom step was built refer to [this blog](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/SAS-Viya-Using-a-SAS-Quality-Knowledge-QKB-Reference-Table-in-a/ta-p/886106)

This custom step is related to the [DQ - Standardize](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-studio-custom-steps/tree/main/DQStandardize) custom step.

## Change Log

* Version 2.2 (19FEB2024)
    * Added note explaining that since SAS Viya 4 release 2023.07 there is a SAS-provided **Mask Data** step in the **Data Transformations** group
      with similar functionality, and that it is highly recommended to use that step going forward.
    * Added cleanup routine to delete SAS macros and SAS macro variables that were created by this step.
* Version 2.1 (26JUL2023)
    * Updated Program code to create SASDQREF library if needed

* Version 2.0 (17JUL2023)
    * Updated step to use **DM_MKDEF** table from the **SASDQREF** library to populate drop-down lists for QKB locale and definition (SASDQREF library containing QKB metadata is available since SAS Viya 2023.06)
    * Drops the column that is being masked
