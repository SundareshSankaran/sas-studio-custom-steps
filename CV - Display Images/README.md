## SAS Viya Version Support

Tested on Viya 4, Stable 2024.01

## Requirements

#### Ensure:

- You are connected to CAS before running this step. This custom step runs on data loaded to SAS Cloud Analytics Services (CAS).

- SAS Viya has access to an active Python environment.  This custom step requires Python (through proc python) to be enabled inside SAS compute.

- Required Python packages (see section "Python packages") are installed.

### Python packages required

- swat (1.13.3)
- python-DLPy (1.2.1-dev - NOTE: This is a dev version and cannot be directly pip installed. Instead, to access this version, use the command "pip install git+https://github. com/sassoftware/python-dlpy.git")
- matplotlib

Refer documentation link below for package details. 

### Parameters

#### Input:
1. Input table name (Required): Select/attach an input table node to this custom step. Provide a valid table name and caslib name of the CAS table containing images which the user would like to view. 

2.  Number of images to view (Optional): Provide an input value for the number of images to be displayed to the user. By default, the value is set to 3. 

3. The data consists of DICOM images (Optional): Choose whether the data contains 3-Dimensional medical DICOM images. By default, the option is set to No.

5. Peter Styliadis provides this helpful post (SAS documentation link contained therein) on how to identify a current active CAS session: https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Viya/Programmatically-detect-an-active-CAS-session/m-p/890914#M1985

## Ideas for future enhancements
 - Modify Python routine to create a CAS session using SAS.submit() when there is no existing CAS session. Currently, when there is no CAS session a new one will be created using SWAT. Which means that SAS Compute has no knowledge about the CAS session. Code snippets can be found [here](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-studio-custom-steps/tree/main/_codegen_snippets/code-samples/Reuse-CAS-session-from-SWAT#alternative-approaches-when-cas-session-does-not-exist).
