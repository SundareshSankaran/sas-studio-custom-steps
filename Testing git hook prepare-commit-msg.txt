Updated .git/hooks to include a file prepare-commit-msg.txt

That file should automatically add a signed-by-line to each commmit
as described in the following stackoverflow posting:

This test is about seeing if GitHub Desktop commits use this.

a git config --list shows that the following definitions are known:
user.name: snlwih
user.email: wilbram.hazejager@sas.com
