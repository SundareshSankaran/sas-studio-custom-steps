					"text": "Python - Create a virtual environment\n\nThe \"Python - Create a virtual environment\" custom step helps users create a virtual Python environment, install a given set of packages, and work within the confines of the new Python environment for project or program-specific purposes.\n\nUsers may choose to persist the virtual environment folder for later reuse, by simply providing a full path to a persistent location, when asked to provide a name for the location (make sure to include the name for the virtualenv folder - i.e. /path/to/storage/venv).  In such a case, please provide a path on a shared file system, which you expect to access through another SAS session later on.  Most SAS Viya deployments may contain a /mnt/... folder location which serves this purpose.\n\nUsers also have an option to provide a requirements file consisting of packages which they would like pip-installed.  Either provide a path to a requirements.txt file which contains a list of python packages (and optionally, specific versions), or provide a list of packages as a string, separated by a space.\n\nCreated / contact : Sundaresh Sankaran (sundaresh.sankaran@sas.com) and Ali Aiello (ali.aiello@sas.com) \n\nVersion : 1.0.  (20MAY2022)\n\nFor more details, refer https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2022/05/16/python-a-la-carte/",
