Please provide a path on a shared file system, which you expect to access through another SAS session later on.  Most SAS Viya deployments may contain a /mnt/... folder location which serves this purpose.\n\nUsers also have an option to provide a requirements file consisting of packages which they would like pip-installed.  Either provide a path to a requirements.txt file which contains a list of python packages (and optionally, specific versions), or provide a list of packages as a string, separated by a space.\n\nFor more details, refer https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2022/05/16/python-a-la-carte/",
